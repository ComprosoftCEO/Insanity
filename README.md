# Insanity
An esoteric programming language that consists of single symbol commands.

## Abstract
Insanity is a programming language designed by Bryan McClain. Similar to assembly, Insanity uses single-symbol commands such as < + and $ to represent simple operations. All text characters that arenâ€™t commands are ignored, unless part of a label or jump command. Whitespace (spacebar, tab, etc.) is ignored, even when inside a label.
